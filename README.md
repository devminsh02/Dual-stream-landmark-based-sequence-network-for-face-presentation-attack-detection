This repository presents a **Dual-Stream neural architecture** designed for Face Presentation Attack Detection (PAD).  
The system distinguishes real faces from spoofing attacks (printed photos, digital screen replays, etc.) by analyzing **frame-to-frame photometric changes** at **468 facial landmark points**.

MediaPipe FaceMesh is used to extract landmark coordinates, followed by computation of **color and brightness variation** between consecutive frames.  
These signals are stabilized using a **Kalman filter** and modeled through a **Dual-Stream BiLSTM network**.

<h3> ✨ Key Contributions</h3>

- **Photometric variation–based PAD** using only RGB-derived temporal changes, without relying on 3D geometry or texture learning
- **Dual-Stream architecture** combining frame-level statistics and sequential temporal dynamics
- **Kalman smoothing** to mitigate landmark detection noise and improve time-series consistency
- **Experimentally proven** superiority over single-branch baselines



<h3> 🗂 Dataset</h3>

This research uses the **MSU Mobile Face Spoofing Database (MSU-MFSD)**,  
which contains replay and printed attack videos recorded with multiple devices.

- **Total samples used:** 128 videos  
  - **Real (Bona fide)**: 64  
  - **Attack (Print / Display)**: 64  
- **Split**
  - **Train set**: 80 videos (51 real + 51 attack)
  - **Test set**: 26 videos (13 real + 13 attack)
  - **Validation**: 20% of training dataset
- Average duration ~12 seconds at 30 FPS (~360 frames per video)
- Converted to CSV sequences through landmark-based photometric extraction

## 🎯 Motivation

Conventional PAD approaches relying on texture features or single-frame analysis suffer severe performance degradation under variations in **illumination**, **camera quality**, and **screen artifacts**.  

This work demonstrates that **temporal photometric variation alone** can effectively separate real from spoofed faces, enabling a **lightweight and robust** PAD framework suitable for real-time applications.

## 🚀 Future Work

- Replay & 3D mask attack extension
- Transformer or Graph Neural Network integration
- Cross-dataset evaluation
- Real-time optimization
